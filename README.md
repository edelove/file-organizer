# Simple file organizer

This is a simple python script that scans given path, detects files and file types (while skipping the directories) and sorts them by extension type.
Respective folders are created (by extension) and the files are being moved there.

# USAGE
1. Run the script
2. Provide the path you want to sort/organize
3. Files are sorted into folders by their extensions. (e.g. ".pdf" => 'path/PDF')
